Fort St. George (or historically, White Town)[1] is a fortress at the coastal city of Chennai,
India. Founded in 1639, it was the first English (later British) fortress in India.[2] The
construction of the fort provided the impetus for further settlements and trading activity,
in what was originally an uninhabited land.[3] Thus, it is a feasible contention to say that
the city (named Madras since before the arrival of the Europeans until July 1996) evolved 
around the fortress.[4] The fort currently houses the Tamil Nadu legislative assembly and 
other official buildings.
